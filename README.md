# Initialization-of-Weights-in-Deep-Neural-Networks



<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this notebook I learned how to initialize the weights in the deep neural networks project. As you know, training neural network requires specifying an initial value of the weights. A well chosen initialization method will help learning.

Here I experimented with three initialization methods.
- Zeros initialization
- Random initialization
- He initialization

For each initialization method I created

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
